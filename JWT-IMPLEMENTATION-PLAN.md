# JWT Authentication Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the strategy for completing and hardening the JWT-based authentication system for CS Brain Tracker. The current implementation has a solid foundation but requires key configuration, thorough testing, and security validation to be considered production-ready. This project leverages AI-assisted development to ensure a secure, reliable, and maintainable authentication module.

## Objective

To deliver a fully functional, secure, and well-documented JWT authentication system that passes all tests and adheres to modern security best practices.

## Development Approach

This project utilizes AI-assisted development with:
- **Claude Code**: Core implementation and security review
- **GitHub Copilot**: Code completion and suggestions
- **Solo Developer**: Project ownership and decision-making

## Project Phases & Timeline

### Phase 1: Configuration & Setup (30 minutes)
**Milestone 1.1: Generate & Validate RSA Keys**
- Generate 4096-bit RS256 key pair
- Deliverable: Key files in `keys/` directory

**Milestone 1.2: Configure Environment Variables**
- Add JWT configuration to `.env`
- Deliverable: Complete environment configuration

**Milestone 1.3: Update Documentation**
- Update `.env.example` and CLAUDE.md
- Deliverable: Current documentation

### Phase 2: Testing & Validation (1 hour)
**Milestone 2.1: Fix Existing Tests**
- Run Jest suite and resolve failures
- Deliverable: Passing test suite

**Milestone 2.2: Enhance Test Coverage**
- Add edge case tests (expiration, token binding, invalid claims)
- Deliverable: >95% test coverage for auth modules

### Phase 3: Security Hardening & Verification (30 minutes)
**Milestone 3.1: AI-Assisted Security Review**
- Use Claude Code to review against OWASP JWT best practices
- Self-audit using security checklist
- Deliverable: Security findings addressed

**Milestone 3.2: Final Verification**
- End-to-end test of complete auth flow
- Deliverable: Working authentication system

## Resource Requirements

**Personnel:**
- 1x Developer (You) with AI assistance
- Claude Code for implementation guidance and security review
- GitHub Copilot for rapid code generation

**Tools:**
- OpenSSL for RSA key generation
- Node.js/npm for application runtime
- Jest for testing
- AI development tools (Claude Code, Copilot)

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Incorrect key generation | Low | High | Use documented OpenSSL commands with AI verification |
| Test failures | Medium | Medium | AI-assisted debugging with Claude Code |
| Security vulnerabilities | Low | High | Multiple AI reviews + OWASP checklist validation |
| Time overrun | Low | Low | AI assistance accelerates development |

## Success Criteria

- ✅ 100% test pass rate
- ✅ >95% code coverage for auth modules
- ✅ Clear documentation for setup
- ✅ Security best practices validated
- ✅ Working end-to-end authentication flow

## Implementation Checklist

### Configuration
- [ ] Generate RSA keys: `openssl genrsa -out keys/private.pem 4096`
- [ ] Extract public key: `openssl rsa -in keys/private.pem -pubout -out keys/public.pem`
- [ ] Set file permissions: `chmod 600 keys/*.pem`
- [ ] Configure `.env` with JWT settings
- [ ] Update `.env.example`

### Testing
- [ ] Run test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Fix any failing tests
- [ ] Add edge case tests
- [ ] Verify coverage: `npm test -- --coverage`

### Security
- [ ] Validate key strength (4096-bit)
- [ ] Verify token expiration times
- [ ] Test refresh token rotation
- [ ] Confirm device fingerprinting works
- [ ] Review against OWASP guidelines

### Documentation
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with auth details
- [ ] Add auth setup to README.md
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Include example requests

## Total Estimated Time: 2 hours

This streamlined approach leverages AI assistance to complete what would traditionally take 10+ hours in just 2 hours, while maintaining high quality and security standards.

## Next Steps

1. Begin with Phase 1 configuration tasks
2. Use AI tools actively throughout implementation
3. Self-review using provided checklists
4. Deploy with confidence knowing AI has assisted in security validation
