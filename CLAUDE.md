# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

CS Brain Tracker is an AI-powered learning tracker API designed to capture and analyze learning sessions from CS Brain vault (Obsidian-based knowledge management system). It provides RESTful endpoints for tracking learning captures with real-time analytics capabilities.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development server with hot reload (nodemon)
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Lint code (ESLint)
npm run lint

# Format code (Prettier)
npm run format

# Production server
npm start
```

## Architecture

The project follows a layered architecture pattern:

- **Routes** (`src/api/routes/`) - Express route handlers for HTTP endpoints
  - `captures.js` - Full CRUD operations for learning captures with analytics
- **Models** (`src/models/`) - Mongoose schemas for MongoDB data models
  - `LearningCapture.js` - Comprehensive schema with spaced repetition, analytics, and Obsidian integration
- **Config** (`src/config/`) - Configuration modules
  - `database.js` - MongoDB connection with exponential backoff retry logic
- **Services** (`src/services/`) - Business logic layer (to be implemented)
- **Utils** (`src/utils/`) - Shared utility functions (to be implemented)

Entry points:
- `src/server.js` - Server initialization with graceful shutdown handling
- `src/app.js` - Express application with comprehensive middleware stack

## Key Features Implemented

### LearningCapture Model
- **Core fields**: type, content, timestamp, tags, cognitiveLoad, processed
- **Insights**: keyConcepts, connections, difficulty, summary, actionItems
- **Obsidian Integration**: noteId, notePath, vaultName, linkedNotes
- **Learning Metrics**: retentionScore, reviewCount, masteryLevel, spaced repetition
- **Analytics**: viewCount, helpfulCount, flagging system
- **Methods**: calculateNextReviewDate(), recordReview(), findRelated()

### API Endpoints (`/api/v1/captures`)
- `GET /` - List with pagination, filtering by type/tags/date, text search
- `GET /stats` - Comprehensive analytics (by type, difficulty, daily velocity)
- `GET /search` - Advanced search with concept filtering
- `GET /:id` - Get single capture (increments view count)
- `POST /` - Create new capture
- `PUT /:id` - Update capture
- `DELETE /:id` - Soft delete
- `POST /bulk` - Bulk import from CS Brain exports
- `POST /:id/review` - Record review session
- `GET /:id/related` - Find related captures

### Security & Performance
- Helmet with CSP configuration
- CORS with configurable origins
- Rate limiting (100 req/15min production, 1000 dev)
- MongoDB injection prevention
- Response compression
- Request ID tracking
- Comprehensive error handling

## Database Configuration

MongoDB connection:
- Default: `mongodb://localhost:58745/cs_brain_tracker`
- Connection pooling (max 10)
- Exponential backoff retry (5 attempts)
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Connection event monitoring

## Environment Variables

Required in `.env`:
- `MONGODB_URI` - MongoDB connection string (default: localhost:58745)
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 3000)
- `HOST` - Server host (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment (development/production)

Optional:
- `SENTRY_DSN` - Sentry error tracking
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` - Comma-separated CORS origins

## Development Workflow

1. Run `npm run dev` to start development server with hot reload
2. Access health check at `http://localhost:3000/health`
3. API base URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1`
4. Use provided endpoints for CRUD operations on learning captures

## Testing & Quality

- Run `npm run lint` before committing to check for ESLint errors
- Run `npm run format` to auto-format code with Prettier
- Test endpoints with tools like Postman or curl
- Monitor MongoDB connection status via health endpoint

## MongoDB Quick Setup

Use the `quick-start.sh` script to verify MongoDB connection:
```bash
chmod +x quick-start.sh
./quick-start.sh
```
